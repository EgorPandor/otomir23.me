## Modifying the code
You can modify this website like any other [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org) website.
To learn more visit Next.js [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/) or complete their free [learning course](https://nextjs.org/learn).

Also, my project uses **yarn** so use 
```bash
yarn dev
```
to start the development server.
